    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="para">This chili dog mac and cheese combines two of my favorite things to eat—chili dogs and mac and cheese—and manages
        not to taste all that much like either one, while being wildly successful at being stupendously delicious.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="para">
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 1</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or
            spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn
            translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 2</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook,
            stirring, for about 2 minutes.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 3</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer.
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30
            minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 4</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in
            macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in
            package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 5</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 6</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer
            mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 7</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili
            mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 8</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.
        </p>
        <strong>
            <li class="item">Step 9</li>
        </strong>
        <p class="para">Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with
            green onions.</p>

    </ol>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p class="para">Substitute sour cream for the yogurt, if desired.</p>
    <p class="para">Stovetop method: Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Preheat a large saute pan on
        medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Add oil, then chicken; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add
        shallots, garlic, and paprika; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pasta sauce and vinegar, then cover and
        reduce heat to low; simmer until chicken registers 185 degrees F (85 degrees C) on a thermometer, 15 to 18
        minutes. Meanwhile, cook egg noodles. Drain well, then return noodles to the pot. Add butter, parsley, and
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper; stir until butter is melted. Remove saute pan from heat and lightly
        shred chicken; stir in 1/2 cup yogurt. Divide noodles evenly among serving plates; top with even amounts chicken
        mixture and remaining yogurt. Serve immediately.</p>
    <p class="para">Omit chicken broth if following the stovetop method.</p>
