    <ol>
        <strong>
            <li>Step 1</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</p>
        <strong>
            <li>Step 2</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and swirl to coat skillet evenly. Add
            onions to skillet in one even layer; top with ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Cook
            undisturbed until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir beef and onions until well combined, and
            cook until beef is cooked through and browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer.</p>

        <strong>
            <li>Step 3</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium. Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Cook, stirring often,
            for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well
            combined.</p>

        <strong>
            <li>Step 4</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine. Arrange tater tots decoratively over beef mixture in
            the skillet, avoiding large gaps between tots.</p>
        <strong>
            <li>Step 5</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with cheese and
            scallions; cool 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>Substitute sour cream for the yogurt, if desired.</p>
    <p>Stovetop method: Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Preheat a large saute pan on
        medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Add oil, then chicken; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add
        shallots, garlic, and paprika; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pasta sauce and vinegar, then cover and
        reduce heat to low; simmer until chicken registers 185 degrees F (85 degrees C) on a thermometer, 15 to 18
        minutes. Meanwhile, cook egg noodles. Drain well, then return noodles to the pot. Add butter, parsley, and
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper; stir until butter is melted. Remove saute pan from heat and lightly
        shred chicken; stir in 1/2 cup yogurt. Divide noodles evenly among serving plates; top with even amounts chicken
        mixture and remaining yogurt. Serve immediately.</p>
    <p>Omit chicken broth if following the stovetop method.</p>
